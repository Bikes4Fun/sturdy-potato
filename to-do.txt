*** comment code *** 

ability to easily specify customizations:
    encoding type
    profiler on/off+num lines
    various solvers
    cleanup yes/no
    specify CNF in standard/debug mode

color test outputs (should be a setting?)
test room overlaps
test professor specific overlaps



encoding types: 
pairwise    = 0
seqcounter  = 1
sortnetwrk  = 2
cardnetwrk  = 3
bitwise     = 4
ladder      = 5
totalizer   = 6
mtotalizer  = 7
kmtotalizer = 8
native      = 9
